<h2>Laravel 5.3 and Angular 2 powered app, work still in progress </h2>
<p> Other technologies: vagrant, sass, elixir(gulp), eloquent(ORM), mysql, bootstrap(responsive), ES6/TypeScript and webpack </p>
<p> Frontend files, components, services & models can be found from /resources/assets/typescript </p>
<p> Backend files, controllers, models & migrations can be found under app/ -folder </p>
<p> Sass is currently in one file(problems with gulp), it can be found under /resources/assets/sass folder </p>
<p>App is designed for telemarketing companies, currently doing it for my friend's company </p>
<p> Some nice features: JWT-based authentication(laravel also provides one, but decided to make my own), reusable pagination component (soon in npm) and AJAX-based pagination. Currently theres about 80k companies on the database so ajax based pagination is kinda must here</p>
<p> The companies are scraped from Patentti ja rekisterihallitus at the moment, the scraper script is not included in this project </p>
<p> Feel free to use</p>
